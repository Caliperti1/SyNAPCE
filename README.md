### Block Runner 

Block Runner is MATLAB based video game where a user must navigate themselves thorugh a series of blocks by shifting their center of mass on a force plate. This code is now used as part of a protocol to evaluate a component of postural conrtol coined postural agility. See the team's recent publication (mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/23/7420) for an overview of the procedure. Block runner is a bespoke program built on top of an AMTI software package for interfacing with their forceplate hardware.
